### Other features
 - Mouse movement event handling: Mouse movement event handling plays a key role in our game. For example, each time the player stages, the mouse pointer will display a picture that tells the player the current activity.
 - Mouse wheel event handling: Mouse wheel event handling plays a key role. When the player is in the rotating Assam phase, the rotating image also moves with the mouse wheel, which provides an intuitive way for the player to rotate the character. When the Rugs stage is placed, the blanket also changes state with the mouse wheel.
 - Mouse click event handling: Mouse click events also play an important role in our game. For example, when the player clicks the mouse to confirm the rotation of Assam, the game applies the rotation to the character and updates the state of the game. In addition, when the player clicks the mouse to roll the dice, the game generates a random number and moves the Assam based on that number. In addition, when the player clicks the mouse on the game interface to place a game element, if the placement is effective, the game updates the interface to reflect the new placement.
 - AI player design: The game also includes an AI player that can automate the actions of the game. The design of this AI player includes a lot of complex logic. For example, AI players automatically perform actions at the beginning of each round, including rotating Assam, rolling dice, and placing game elements. AI players' actions are based on a predefined strategy that takes into account the current state of the game, as well as possible future states. This design allows the AI player to act as a formidable opponent, providing more challenges for the player.
